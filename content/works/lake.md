Our visual perception seems to be dominant. We often find ourselves in awe of a stunning scenery: A sunset, a waterfall, a mountain range, the eyes of another person.

Our other senses seem to be insufficient in this regard, a mere underlining of our visual impressions. On vacation we make photo albums, never sound collections.

There is music in every breath of a swimmer in the distance, in the menacing growling of the wind, in the waves crashing on the shore, in insects buzzing, in the birds chirping. There is music in everything. Awe-inspiring music.
