I am shitting in a room. A short moment of rest while the world marches on mercilessly. A moment of safety, for I know every nook and cranny,
every smell and sound.
When I open the bathroom door the space doubles and triples its size in an
instant. I get dizzy. How long have I been sitting there?
I leave the building and the world grows to incomprehensible dimensions.
Too much to bear. When is this finally over? Time stops flowing, becomes
viscous and gooey.
A horribly deformed stage stands in for the bathroom. A stage is an
imaginary space that allows time to be molded. Dimension reduction
to the point of illegibility. Expanding in complexity simultaneously.
Control just as imaginary.
Thus, an audio-visual live performance bound to fail.
But at least it will end soon enough.
