A lively and largely one-sided conversation about walls and gorges in three acts; a piece for IKO Speaker, light, wood and performer.

_Note: The IKO is a 3D audio speaker developed by the IEM. The 3D part makes documenting the piece a bit tricky. The video above is simply a binaural reproduction._
