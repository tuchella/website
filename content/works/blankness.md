Reflektor Etude #1; or Walkie-Talkie II

The pale surface is both a door and a wall. It defines and 
demarcates the space with its presence, until its quiet 
white opens up an infinitely large space of nothing,

a boundless expanse that stretches 

into endlessness. 

It cycles relentlessly like the air pressure that implies 
nothing. Attempting for a moment to halt the unyielding 
embrace of sound waves reflected by reality. 

To halt the blankness in an unstained state.

To halt the senselessness.
