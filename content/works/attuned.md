There have been only two significant art movements in the history of art: Dada and Fluxus. Dada allowed everything to become art. Fluxus allowed nothing to become art.

With Fluxus art was no longer tangible, existing solely as a thought in the impalpable realm of ideas. Finally free. 

This is an experiment to gain access to these ideas, to this idea:  

> ***Attune*** \
> *Find the note in the octave which is yours.* \
> &nbsp; - Larry Miller, 1981 

**Details** \
Three individuals finding their note (assisted by a video projection and sound).

A microphone records the individual's voice. The prevalent frequencies are emphasized by the corresponding note names on the projection and the sound of several matching sine waves.
