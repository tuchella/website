From the fluxus work book:

> ***Attune*** \
> *Find the note in the octave which is yours.* \
> &nbsp; - Larry Miller, 1981 

Three individuals finding their note (assisted by a video projection and sound).

A microphone records the individual's voice. The prevalent frequencies are emphasized by the corresponding note names on the projection and the sound of several matching sine waves.
