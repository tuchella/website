Every acoustically generated sound is necessarily preceded by physical movement, often in the form of a human body. With electronically and digitally generated sounds, this relationship no longer seems to exist. But behind every such sound there is a vast amount of code that makes the sound production possible in the first place. This code, in turn, is created by human movements behind a screen and a keyboard. A relationship between body and sound therefore also exists in the digital world, albeit more indirectly and with a time delay. The live-coding performance will shed light on this relationship. The physicality in the act of programming becomes the act of making music.
