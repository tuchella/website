Performance for live coding, stage piano and a neural network. 

Code is written live on stage to connect player and computer. The notes played on the piano is fed into the neural network, which attempts to continue to musical progression. This in turn forces the piano player to react, creating a feedback loop. Lines are blurred between artist, performer, worker and computer. 

Developed and performed for Manifesta 11 in Zurich as part of the series *Cabaret der KÃ¼nstler - Zunfthaus Voltaire*.

w/ Python, Tensorflow, FluidSynth, jackd, vim
