I got the chance to perform at Manifesta 11 in Zurich as part of the series *Cabaret der KÃ¼nstler - Zunfthaus Voltaire*. It was pretty scary to perform in front of an audience for the first time. But it was great! Even though not everything worked out as I planned. The performance is described [in the concept](/img/02/concept.jpg) I submitted. The first image shows the screen on the  stage after I left. Dots representing a note played by the pianist, colons notes played by the algorithm. 

But anyway it was an extremely insightful experience. Some points for me to remember for future events: 

1. Stay calm. I got really nervous at one point and started just switching windows really fast, changing large chunks of text at once and just generally getting pretty messy, which caused some confusion in the audience. 
2. Be grateful for the people around you. Without the people who organized this event and all the people who helped me (especially these [two guys](https://www.facebook.com/hiWeAreTheEs/) (one of whom played the pianist)) this would have never been possible.
3. Check the final setup. Just because there's a MIDI standard doesn't mean that every MIDI keyboard will work as expected. Luckily we got everything working eventually. 
4. Remember the audience's point-of-view. After the performance some people from the audience came up to me and asked me to explain what just happened. Which in my opinion had two main causes: First me getting sloppy as mentioned above and second code just generally being confusing to non-programmers, even though I tried to write the code as comprehensible as possible. 

Some things also worked out great: The people that had questions after the performance first approached the pianist instead of me. So the whole idea of showing the blurred lines between artist/worker/computer worked I think. And the moment when we both  had left the stage and it was just the algorithm playing on its own, that moment was magical (even tough the music was pretty horrible).
