Inspired by an [untitled painting](https://www.museum-brandhorst.de/en/collection/untitled-gaeta-468/) by Cy Twombly, which features an inscription of a poem by George Seferis. 

```
  The light
  is a
   ┌┐ 
  └┘└┘

  Continually
  slower and
  slower

  U think it
  is about to
  stop 
```

From poetry to painting to sound.
