I got the chance to perform at Manifesta 11 in Zurich as part of the series *Cabaret der KÃ¼nstler - Zunfthaus Voltaire*. It was pretty scary to perform in front of an audience for the first time. But it was great! Even though not everything worked out as I planned. I got really nervous at one point and messed up a little. And after the performance some people came up to me and asked if I could explain what just happened, so although I tried to write the code as comprehensible as possible it's still code which seems confusing to non-programmers. What's more it sounded horrible. 

But some stuff worked out great: The people that had questions after the performance first approached the pianist instead of me. So the whole idea of showing the blurred lines between artist/worker/computer worked I think. And the moment when we both  had left the stage and it was just the algorithm playing on its own. That moment was magical.

I'm really grateful for this possibility and all the people who helped me (especially these [two guys](https://www.facebook.com/hiWeAreTheEs/)).
