A record, an audio cassette, a compact disc and an empty frame. 

This is the first thing I made that *could* loosely be described as art. But this immediately raised the question for me about what exactly 'art' is. Not a very original thought, sure but it occurred to me back then and I think the rise of art works existing solely in a digital space adds something to it that was not present when Socrates was still around and bothering the people of Athens with his questions. With many 'works of art' existing simultaneously on the hard disks of multiple computers or just on one hard disk - and then be gone forever due to a technical error and the creators lack of foresight [here could be a paid promotion for your online backup service] we must get rid of the idea that an art work is something that exists as an entity in the physical realm. What we previously considered art works are - as Joseph Kosuth put it - nothing more than a physical residue, a clue that art happened, a measure to improve accessibility. Which can come in many forms, some of which are visible, some of which are tactile, some of which are audible and some of which are neither of those things.
