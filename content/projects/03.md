I love nature. That is, I love everything. The supposed difference between natural and human-made does not exist. If a tree grows naturally and due to the laws of gravity loses its seeds, the resulting tree is also a product of nature. This is to show that every product that results from a natural process out of a natural thing is itself a natural thing. Now our beautiful planet was formed naturally a couple years ago. Some time later life started to form. A fact I still can't wrap my head around, so let's just move on. Thanks to evolution - which is a natural process - humans started to show up. Therefore humans are natural. Now everything we do is governed by laws of nature. Every thought, every action is caused by electrical stimuli in our nervous system, which is - as you might have guessed - governed by laws of nature. So everything we do results due to a natural process out of another natural being: us humans. Therefore there can be no distinction between natural and non-natural. And whether something is natural can not serve as a criteria to tell whether it is good or bad.
