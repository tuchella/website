No man is an island, \\
Entire of itself. \\
Each is a piece of the continent, \\
A part of the main. \\
If a clod be washed away by the sea, \\
Europe is the less. \\
As well as if a promontory were. \\
As well as if a manor of thine own \\
Or of thine friend's were. \\
Each man's death diminishes me, \\
For I am involved in mankind. \\
**Therefore, send not to know** \\
**For whom the bell tolls,** \\
**It tolls for thee.** 

*John Donne*
