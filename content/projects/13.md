I visited a Cy Twombly exhibition in Munich last year. While wandering through the museum halls I overheard the usual "My grandson could paint that" comment. I'm still confused by such comments. Obviously I'm not into every type of art, but I think there is something in every work of art that separates it from a child's mindless scribbling.

Anyways, half way through I came across an untitled painting which featured an inscription of  a poem by George Seferis. It captivated me. This is my attempt to express what this painting means to me. 

> *The light* \
> *is a* \

> *Continually* \
> *slower and* \
> *slower*

> *U think it* \
> *is about to* \
> *stop*

From poetry to painting to sound.
