Death is a disease. It must be stopped. But we are told to live with it - ha - and started to accept it as part of nature. 

Children die. They are weak. That's part of nature. \\
**No** \\
Child mortality went down by 50% in the last fifteen years. 

The plague kills people. That's part of nature. \\
**No** \\
In the 14th century 50 million people died. Fifty million. Today 600 get infected each year. 

Cancer kills people. That's part of nature. \\
**No** \\
We can cure it. We can't cure it yet. We can cure more cases each year.  

You are born, you age and then you die. That's part of nature. \\
**No** \\
There is no limit to longevity. Some jellyfishes and flatworms can live forever.  

I can't stand people telling me that they *"don't have to do anything but die"*. You don't have to die. I don't have to die. They didn't have to die. We could stop it. 

In protest against this delusion I have not died since 1994 and plan on doing so.
